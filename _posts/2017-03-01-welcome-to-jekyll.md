#To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes #the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

#Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

#{% highlight ruby %}
#def print_hi(name)
  #puts "Hi, #{name}"
#end
#print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
#{% endhighlight %}
